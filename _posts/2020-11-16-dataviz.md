## Executive_Summary
It is clear, given the statistics, that flying is still safer than driving. Misinformation was spread in 2014 following the downing of Malaysia Flight 17 and the disappearance of Malaysia Flight 370 (Silver, 2014). Although 2014 was a bad year for the airline industry, so was 2001, 2008, and now 2020. Historically, however, it has taken the industry about three years to recover. The impact of the events of September 11, 2001 were devastating to the airlines. The 2008 Recession caused fuel prices to soar, affecting the airline industry (US DoT, 2012). The mass media coverage of the Malaysian flights in 2014 impacted air travel. The current pandemic is certainly impacting air travel more than ever right now.
