# Cincinnati Crime Statistics
A Statistical Analysis.
<br>
Use R to analyze Cincinnati crime statistics to identify location and times of concern.

## Introduction
I sought out to see how I could find insight in crime data from the City of Cincinnati. Different datasets were available for shootings, violent crimes, criminal incidents, and non-criminal reporting. I chose to focus on criminal incidents, since it reflected reporting for multiple offenses. I reviewed geodetic and neighborhood location data to better understand the scope of the problem.

## Problem Statement
There has been an increase in crime in the CIncinnati area. This increase has inflated visibility, and the community is calling for increased patrols. The city now has a reputation for shootings, and the media has increased their reporting of events. An acceptable solution will deter future crimes and provide a sense of security in the community.

## Addressing the Problem
I sought out to determine whether there was an increase in crime, or just an increase in the reporting of crimes. To do this, I viewed the data in a variety of ways. I viewed distribution of reported incidents and their frequencies. I grouped the data in a variety of ways and derived numeric counts to further analyze. I looked for a correlation between these counts to see if a predictive model could be useful. Most helpful to addressing the problem was the comparison between the number of reported incidents to the closure status of those reports. Did the incidents reported result in arrests or closures? I was able to build a linear model to predict the closure status.

## Data Source
PDI (Police Data Initiative) Crime Incidents, City of Cincinnati.  Incidents are the records of reported crimes, collated by an agency for management. Incidents are typically housed in a Records Management System (RMS) that stores agency-wide data about law enforcement operations.
