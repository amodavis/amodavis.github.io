# College Recommendation Engine
A machine learning case study for unsupervised clustering.
<br>
<br>
Uses unsupervised learning to determine clusters of colleges. Given a specific school of interest, recommends others in the same cluster.
<br>
## Abstract
This project is catered to future and current college students and their parents.  As a parent of a prospective student, I noticed a lot of data in disparate systems with inconsistent results.  There are many resources to the point that it is overwhelming.
<br>
<br>
The intent of this project is to demonstrate a use case in unsupervised learning.  In it, you will see the problem defined and business objective set.  I will guide you through my research and methodologies, resulting in a usable recommendation engine.

## Introduction
One of the greatest challenges faced by high school students and their parents is selecting a college.  This is perhaps the first major decision in a young person’s life.  It can also be the most costly.  Like any big decision, it is imperative to perform research and not come to a hasty resolution.

## Business Problem
Searching for a college is too time consuming and often only includes limited features.  A college visit or interview is the only good way to find a college that “fits,” but it is impossible to visit all college campuses.
***Business Objective: Make it easier to find a college that “fits.”***

## Data Source
Scorecard data from the US Department of Education 
https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/

## Modeling Objective
The ultimate question that remains is, which college should we look at.  Which colleges would be the best “fit?” 
***Modeling Objective: Perform unsupervised learning to form school clusters.***
