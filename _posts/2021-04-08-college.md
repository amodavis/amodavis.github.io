# College Recommendation Engine
A machine learning case study for unsupervised clustering.
<br>
<br>
Uses unsupervised learning to determine clusters of colleges. Given a specific school of interest, recommends others in the same cluster.
<br>
<br>
This project is catered to future and current college students and their parents.  As a parent of a prospective student, I noticed a lot of data in disparate systems with inconsistent results.  There are many resources to the point that it is overwhelming.
<br>
<br>
The intent of this project is to demonstrate a use case in unsupervised learning.  In it, you will see the problem defined and business objective set.  I will guide you through my research and methodologies, resulting in a usable recommendation engine.
