# Breast Cancer Study - A Machine Learning Case Study using Logistic Regression
An Exploratory Data Analysis of NWS Storm Data 
<br>
Analyze data to determine factors that increase survival of breast cancer patients.
<br>
With data science so prevalent during the ongoing pandemic, I wanted to dive into something in the health field.  Unfortunately, most of the health data I found was aggregated more than I wanted.  I realize a lot of this is done for protection of individuals, but itâ€™s difficult to perform analysis, without knowing all the factors that went into the outcome.  I was looking for something that addresses individuals of varying demographics.
