# Zero Trust
A machine learning case study for supervised classification.
<br>
<br>
Uses supervised learning to classify network traffic. Reviews Wireshark logs to determine if traffic is coming from the DarkNet.

## Abstract
As the amount of data we share increases, cybersecurity becomes more critical to protect it.  We have also seen the need for accessibility increase during the pandemic.  
Users are connecting from multiple locations on multiple devices.  It is necessary to provide this flexibility, while still securing our networks.  
To enable more access, we must review and validate user access and network access continually.  Machine learning is critical to achieving this goal.

## Introduction
This data will come from the Cybersecurity realm supporting the Zero Trust model, in which the mantra is “Never trust, always verify.”
