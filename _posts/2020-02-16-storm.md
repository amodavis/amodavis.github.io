# Storm Data
An Exploratory Data Analysis of NWS Storm Data.  
<br>
Uses Python to evaluate storm events data from the National Weather Service to assist in determining if storms are becoming more intense.

## Introduction
I wanted to tackle whether “storms are getting more intense.” In my comparisons between 1999 and 2019 data, I found only slight differences in the intensity of storms, as measured by wind speed and hail size. The magnitude of the size of storms, however, decreased by almost 50%. The value of property damage also decreased. This led me to conclude that storms are not getting more intense when looking at this specific twenty-year comparison.

## Hypothesis
Storms are getting more intense.
