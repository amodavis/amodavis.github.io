## Recurrent Neural Networks
### Text Processing
Transforms text input into tokens and convert those tokens into numeric vectors using one-hot encoding and feature hashing.  Builds basic text-processing models using recurrent neural networks (RNN).  Demonstrates how word embeddings such as Word2Vec can help improve the performance of text-processing models.
