# Vet Hospital Wait Times
A machine learning case study for supervised regression.
<br>
<br>
Uses supervised learning to determine clusters of colleges. Given a specific school of interest, recommends others in the same cluster.
<br>
<br>
This project was requested by a veterinary hospital to address wait times. 
They are unable to estimate how long a patient is expected to wait due to urgent cases that come in and require special attention. 
Currently, staff just provides a wild guess on how long the wait will be. The intent of this project is to demonstrate a use case in supervised regression. 
In it, you will see the problem defined and business objective set. I will guide you through my research and methodologies, resulting in a usable wait time estimator.
