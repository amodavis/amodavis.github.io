Iâ€™m a data scientist with 25 years data experience with SQL and Awk.  I am expanding into machine learning, utilizing Python and R programming. I specialize in data wrangling but am reaching into the use of commercial tools in the Cloud, such as Trifacta and Databricks.  Always looking to provide continual service improvement.
